Get a weather report for a UK postcode
This code runs on node.js (on the command line) so you'll need that installed.
It relies on two APIs:
  - http://postcodes.io/
  - https://developer.forecast.io/

You will need to register for an API key for forecast.io.
This is my first node project so I'm sure there are potential improvements but I'm uploading this now because at least it works!
Remember you need to put the postcode in with no spaces, so for example:      
$ node weather.js nw16xe
